      <p>
      I am a software engineer at <a href="https://itemis.com">itemis</a>.
      Before that I did my PhD at MPI-SWS in the group for <em>Automated Verification
          and Approximation</em> lead by
        <a href="https://malyzajko.github.io/">Eva Darulova</a>.
	During my PhD I have worked on verified compilation and
        optimization of floating-point programs, and the ergonomics of
        interactive theorem provers.
