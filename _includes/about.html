        I am a PhD student at MPI-SWS in the group for <em>Automated Verification
          and Approximation</em> lead by Eva Darulova. In general I have a strong
        interest in static analysis and compilers, with a strong focus on
        verification.

        We are currently working on building a certification backend for her
        previous work in the Daisy framework. To this end we implement a checker for
        Daisy's results in both Coq and HOL4. The overall goal for our project is to
        support certification of analysis results computed by Daisy.
