      <p>
        I am a PhD student at MPI-SWS in the group for <em>Automated Verification
          and Approximation</em> lead by
        <a href="https://people.mpi-sws.org/~eva">Eva Darulova</a>.
        In general I have a strong interest in verified compilation and
        optimization of floating-point programs, and in ergonomics of
        interactive theorem provers.
